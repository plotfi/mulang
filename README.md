# Âµ-lang

A language just for fun.

Attribution:

The lexer and grammar were taken from this USENET C grammar but will be heavily modified:

* https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/ANSI-C-grammar-y.html
* https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/ANSI-C-grammar-l.html

Goal is to write a parser that builds an AST and codegens LLVM IR.
